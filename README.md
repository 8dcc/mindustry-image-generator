# mindustry-image-generator
This is a web app used to convert an image into code for a Mindustry Micro Processor, so that you can print images on logic displays in the game. You need to have Mindustry 6.0. To use this, go to [the github.io page](https://r4v10l1.github.io/mindustry-image-generator/). This page also explains how to use it.

I don't have very much experience in web development, so a lot of my code may be in poor style. Much of it was copied from the [openCV tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp).

Edit: Tried making it for 160px but it does not work, I will try to make it with python or something.
